American marine biologist Sylvia Earle says “ with every drop you drink, every breath you take, you are connected to the sea”. That’s what I leaned from National Aquarium last week. I have been always thinking about this quote these days and being inspired by it. It reminds me of a TEDx talk I have ever watched named “ everything is connected” by Tom Chi. He says that every hemoglobin that carries Oxygen through our body is made up of iron atom and every iron atom was born from a supermassive star. Actually, all the heavy metal atoms were born from a supernova explosion. So here should be another version of Earle’s quote:

With every heartbeat you experience, every shining stuff you wear, you are connected to the stars.
