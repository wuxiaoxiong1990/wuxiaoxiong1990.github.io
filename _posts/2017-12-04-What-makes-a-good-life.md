More than a century ago, Mark Twain was looking back on his life and he wrote this:
“There isn’t time, so brief is life, for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account. There is only time for loving, and but an instant, so to speak, for that.”
时光荏苒，生命短暂，别将时间浪费在争吵、道歉、伤心和责备上，用时间去爱吧，哪怕只有一瞬间，也不要辜负。
